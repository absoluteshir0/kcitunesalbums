## Third-party libraries used for this project
* Retrofit: for easy implementation of REST API calls
* Okhttp: in combination with Retrofit to log API request and response
* Moshi: JSON converter library for serializing and deserializing objects
* Room Persistence: database library to easily manipulate SQLite

## Architecture
MVP (Model View Presenter) design pattern is used in this project.

Why MVP?
* It's very understandable and easier code maintenance because it separated application's model, view and presenter in layers
* Clear separation of responsibilities between components. This separation allows for an easier understanding and maintenance of the code base.
* Modularity allows you to switch to a different implementation of view component in order to completely change application's UI, while all other components remain intact.
* Easier Testing
